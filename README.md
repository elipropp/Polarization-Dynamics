# Polarization-Dynamics
Course Project for ECE 493 (Foundations of Multi-Agent Systems) at the University of Waterloo.

## Purpose
The idea is to model ideological polarization by simulating an environment where agents are on one of two 'teams', where each team corresponds to one perspective on an issue.

The goal of the project is to simulate and analyze interactions between self-interested agents and observe how the 'opinions' of agents on different teams propogate (do the opinions of those on different teams converge or diverge) depending on the variation of specific variables and the communication network of the agents. Based on a payoff matrix, the agents will be incentivized to work with people from the other team (change their opinions to be more moderate).
